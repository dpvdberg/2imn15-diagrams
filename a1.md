IoT: Assignment 1 
========================

# Philips Hue:
Philips Hue is a smart lighting system that consists of multiple physical components.
## Physical components
- (U) Smartphone/PC/Tablet
- Controller nodes:
    - (I-R) Hue bridge: functions as a bridge between Zigbee devices and the local area network.
    - (T-S) Smart dimmer switch
    - (T-S) Motion sensor
- Light nodes:
    - (T-A) Hue lights (a variety of classes)

Zigbee Light Link: wireless technology to lighting solutions for the home.
ZLL is a library that uses the Zigbee communication protocol.
The Philips Hue ecosystem is built upon this Zigbee Light Link standard.

Software Architecture PLAATJE

ZLL contains two classes of physical devices; controller nodes and light nodes, as is described above.
Controller nodes, as the name suggests, control other nodes in the network.
This might either be remote control units such as switches or (motion/heat) sensors or be a control bridge such as the Philips Hue bridge.
Light nodes are the actual light bulbs in the network, and may differ in functionality; simple on/off lights, dimmable lights, colour lights, etc.
Finally, we have a user device such as a smartphone, which can control the Hue Bridge remotely.


### Third party 
Third party lights and accessories: because Philips Hue uses the Zigbee standard, any light or accessory that uses the wireless Zigbee standard on 2.4 GHz can be added to a Philips Hue system.

Third party applications: Philips Hue was a pioneer when it comes to smart lighting.
Also, the Philips Hue system was open from the beginning, offering interfaces that can be used to program alternative control options.
The result is that there is a wide variety of third party applications, that can be used to control a Philips Hue system.

The downside of using third party lights is that their colour palette might be different than that of the Philips Hue lights, which means combining lights might lead to undesired color combinations.


## Functionalities

### Deployment
In order to start a new network, the Hue bridge needs to be added to the Philips Hue application.
Once the app is installed, it will automatically start searching for Hue bridges.
Once the connection is made, the user has to push a button on the bridge.
This push-link mechanism is a security fail-safe, ensuring that prevents others from connecting to your Hue bridge and thus, being able to control your lights.
https://www.support.com/how-to/how-to-set-up-a-philips-hue-light-10110#:~:text=tap%20Set%20up.-,Go%20to%20your%20Philips%20Hue%20Bridge%20and%20press%20the%20center,to%20add%20a%20new%20room.

### Joining the network
When it comes to joining the network, for any Philips Hue light or accessory has three options:
- Search: once the Philips Hue application is installed and opened, it will automatically start searching for lights. Lights and accessories that are powered for the first time, are automatically in `search mode`, allowing them to be found by the Hue bridge. Once the Hue bridge is done searching, all lights and accessories in search mode are automatically connected to the network. All this works using the Zigbee Commissioning standard, which specifies how new nodes are added to the network. https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/07-5123-06-zigbee-cluster-library-specification.pdf
Third party lights can be re-set (the method depends on the light being used), such that they are also in `search mode`, and can thus be found by the Hue bridge.
- Add serial number: an alternative method is using the Hue app to add lights to the network. This is done by adding the serial number of the light bulb in the Hue app. Afterwards, by starting the search method as defined above, the lights will be connected to the network.
- Touchlink: Zigbee supports a way to add third party lights and accessories to the network, by means of the Touchlink method. Using this method, two devices that are close together can be connected. Here, distance is measured by means of the receive- and transmission-power. PLAATJE
This Touchlink method also has a hazard: some third party lights and accessories have a very wide range (i.e. transmission power), which means sometimes Touchlink works unintentionally over long distances. We see here that these third-party lights can have a negative and unsecure effect on the deployment of a Philips Hue network.

https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/JN-UG-3091.pdf

The result is a mesh network. PLAATJE

### Secure communication

The network initiator, i.e. the Hue bridge, generates a random network key when the network is first formed and encrypts it using the ZLL master key. This network key is sent to any target node that wishes to join the network. The target node decrypts the ZLL master key. Any future communication is encrypted using the network key.
https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/JN-UG-3091.pdf

### Operation

Using the clusters (frames) specified in the ZLL standard, the Hue bridge controls the state of the lights:
Groups, Scenes, On/Off, Level Control, Colour Control.

Accessories such as a switch, dimmer, button are motion sensors are specified in the ZLL standard as control devices and communicate with the Hue bridge to control lights.

### Updates

The Hue bridge is updated using the Philips Hue app.
It checks for updates periodically using the backend system (trusted source).
The upgrade server (hue bridge) is notified of light updates by the backend system and notifies the light that an update is available.
Because the light may be off, the lights also periodically query the bridge for updates.
Lights are then updated using the Over The Air (OTA) Upgrade specified in the Zigbee standard.
Lights therefore update their code using a trusted source, the Hue Bridge.
Note that all communication is secure.

### Normal use case

We will demonstrate the flow of control and flow of data of turning a light on using the Hue app.


### Adding a new device

We will illustrate the flow of control and flow of data of adding a new device to the network via Touchlink.

## Case study
### Internet connection lost
When internet connection is lost, the network itself still exists and all devices - including the Hue bridge - keep working.
As long as the user device is directly connected to the router using a WiFi connection (possibly without internet), the lights can still be controlled using the Hue app.

The only feature that is lost is the fact that the lights cannot be controlled outside the LAN.
This cannot be fixed, and can only be repaired by providing the router with an internet connection.

Additionally, note that without an internet connection, OTA upgrades and bridges updates can no longer be fetched from the internet.

### A device stops working
When a Hue bridge stops working, there is no bridge anymore between the Zigbee devices and the LAN, which means the lights can no longer be controlled using the Hue app.

However, a network can still be built between the Light nodes and controller nodes, which means lights can still be controlled using switches, dimmers, etc.
Some switches support direct connections with lights, for example the Hue dimmer switch can connect with up to ten light bulbs.
Note however that the features of changing the colours or light level of lights is lost, next to the connection to the Hue app.

When a light or controller device is disconnected, it can no longer be controlled by any controller node or the Hue app.
Since the network is a mesh network, the disconnection of a certain node might split the network in two, essentially creating two separate networks.
The network that includes the Hue bridge functions as normal, the nodes in the other network have to be re-connected, or might even be too far away to join the network at all.

If the router stops working, the lights can no longer be controlled by the Hue app.
Additionally, note that without a router, OTA upgrades and bridges updates can no longer be fetched from the internet.

### Conflicting command
Conflicting commands can be given when two separate users try to change the color of the same light.
The light always changes to the colour prescribed in the last command he got, which means the command of one of the two users is lost and the other is executed.
Afterwards, the network functions as usual, which means nothing breaks.

### Privacy
When connected to the internet, the Philips Hue privacy policy states that personal usage data can be collected with unclear purpose. 
Data can be analysed, and used for direct marketing communication.

Data consolidation can be turned off in the Hue app.
Additionally, the Philips Hue system can also be used without an internet connection, as stated above.
In this case, no data can be collected/stored by Philips Hue.

In network they can have different responsibilities:
- End device
- Router eligible
- (Leader)

Gateway
Smart phone/pc/tablet
Google servers

Nest products use Wi-Fi and Thread for various things like downloading software updates, sending app notifications, and devices communicating with each other. Some products only have Wi-Fi, some have only Thread, others have both.
Thread is a type of mesh network. In a mesh network, all devices can act as a router, letting them relay information directly to each other without the need for a central router.
Google has implemented an open version of thread called OpenThread, which can also be used by developers in order to accelerate the development of products for the connected home and commercial buildings.
https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-11-fundamentals-thread.pdf
- improved range
- low power
- independent from WiFi
Google Nest cameras, video doorbells and 2nd gen Nest Protects use Bluetooth Low Energy (or BLE) to connect to your phone or tablet during setup. 2nd gen Protects also use BLE for App Silence and to start a Safety Checkup test.
Google Nest Tag uses NFC when you hold it on Nest Guard to arm and disarm the alarm.

### Third party 

Device Access is a framework that enables access, control, and management of Nest devices within partner apps, solutions and smart home ecosystems, using the Smart Device Management (SDM) API.

https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access


## Functionalities
### Deployment
The philosophy of the Google Nest system is to set-up a Thread network using a border router that supports Thread.
This router is also connected to LAN, such that it can also communicate with Nest products that support WiFi communication.
Such a network can be started by the user, by means of the Nest app and creating an account with a password.

Note that with the rise of Device Access, come additional deployment options where third party apps are used to connect Nest products.

### Joining the network

The mechanism for joining a device to the network depends highly on the device. In general, it consists of the following steps. The first step, if applicable, is to connect the device to the WiFi network. 
This connection is secure, in the sense that Google Nest WiFi devices do not support legacy protocols like WPA and WEP; they only support WPA2 and WPA3. These are deemed as secure.

Next, the device is to be added to the thread network. This is done using the Nest app.
Thread commissioning consists of the following steps:
- Authorizing the commissioner: commissioning device establishes a secure session (DTLS) with the border router using the commissioning passphrase. Next, the border router request commissioning session from leader (to ensure only one commissioner is active at this time). Lastly, the leader notifies the network that a commssioner is active.
- Joining a device: joining device finds router on the network. Joining device and commissioner establish DTLS session using device passphrase. When the device is authorized by commissioner, the joiner router is notified that it can provide network credentials to joining device. Device can then attach to the network.

### Secure communication

All communication between Google Nest devices and Google is secured using TLS.
Additionally, all Google Nest Wifi devices contain a firewall that creates a barrier between the WiFi network and the internet.
https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/6309220?hl=en

Thread utilizes a network-wide key that is used at the Media Access Layer (MAC) for encryption. This key is used for standard IEEE
802.15.4-2006 authentication and encryption. 
Each node in the Thread network exchanges frame counters with
its neighbors via an MLE handshake. These frame counters help protect against replay attacks.
MAC security is used for all messages.

https://www.threadgroup.org/portals/0/documents/resources/Thread_Technical_Overview.pdf

### Operation 

Devices use both Wifi and thread to communicate with each other.
ENTER TABLE

https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9249088?hl=en
This table provides an overview of the Google Nest products available and the way they communicate with each other and the user's application.

Nest products don’t connect to each other through your Wi-Fi router. In most cases, they use Wi-Fi to send their status to the Nest service which then sends that information to other products in your home and the app. In other cases, they use Thread wireless networking to directly connect to each other.


### Updates

Nest products were designed to update themselves. As long as they are connected to WiFi, they will periodically check for updates and retrieve them from the Google servers.
Some devices only support thread, and not WiFi, such as the Nest product `Detect`. In order to be able to update, these devices have to be connected to other tread devices that do support a WiFi connection. Their updates can then be retrieved from the Google servers via these WiFi-connected devices.

## Functionality mapping

Deployment model plaatje

## Case study
### Internet connection lost

When an internet connection is lost, the thread network still behaves as normal, as the thread network is independent of the WiFi network.

Some functionality will be lost, however. Devices are not able to update anymore, as they cannot use WiFi to retrieve updates from the Google servers.
Also, as some devices use WiFi to communicate app notifications and for app remote control, these functionalities will be lost as well.
Because there is no WiFi, devices cannot reach the server and vice versa.


### A device stops working

When one of the devices in the thread network stops working, it might be that some nodes in the thread network might change responsibilities (from end-device to thread router, for example) in order to deal with the sudden gap in the network. Afterwards, everything functions as usual.

If the router stops working, then all nest devices loose their connection to the WiFi, and the network behaves similar to the previously discussed case study.

If the user device breaks, the user will loose the ability to remotely control the devices via the nest app, and devices cannot communicate to the user via the nest app.


### Conflicting command

When conflicting commands are given, all devices will respond to the latest command they got. The other command is lost.


### Privacy 

The Google Privacy policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy) is applicable to all Google products and services.
Data that is always shared are device attributes, activation date and connection status. 
Google also collects data about, for example, user activity and device statistics of Google nest devices. 
Users can choose not to share this data with Google using the privacy settings in the app, and the collected data can also be changed or deleted.

## Life cyles
