IoT: Assignment 1 
========================

# Philips Hue:
Philips Hue is a smart lighting system that consists of multiple physical components.
## Physical components
- (U) Smartphone/PC/Tablet
- Controller nodes:
    - (I-R) Hue bridge: functions as a bridge between Zigbee devices and the local area network.
    - (T-S) Smart dimmer switch
    - (T-S) Motion sensor
- Light nodes:
    - (T-A) Hue lights (a variety of classes)

Zigbee Light Link: wireless technology to lighting solutions for the home.
ZLL is a library that uses the Zigbee communication protocol.
The Philips Hue ecosystem is built upon this Zigbee Light Link standard.

Software Architecture PLAATJE

ZLL contains two classes of physical devices; controller nodes and light nodes, as is described above.
Controller nodes, as the name suggests, control other nodes in the network.
This might either be remote control units such as switches or (motion/heat) sensors or be a control bridge such as the Philips Hue bridge.
Light nodes are the actual light bulbs in the network, and may differ in functionality; simple on/off lights, dimmable lights, colour lights, etc.
Finally, we have a user device such as a smartphone, which can control the Hue Bridge remotely.


### Third party 
Third party lights and accessories: because Philips Hue uses the Zigbee standard, any light or accessory that uses the wireless Zigbee standard on 2.4 GHz can be added to a Philips Hue system.

Third party applications: Philips Hue was a pioneer when it comes to smart lighting.
Also, the Philips Hue system was open from the beginning, offering interfaces that can be used to program alternative control options.
The result is that there is a wide variety of third party applications, that can be used to control a Philips Hue system.

The downside of using third party lights is that their colour palette might be different than that of the Philips Hue lights, which means combining lights might lead to undesired color combinations.


## Functionalities

### Deployment
In order to start a new network, the Hue bridge needs to be added to the Philips Hue application.
Once the app is installed, it will automatically start searching for Hue bridges.
Once the connection is made, the user has to push a button on the bridge.
This push-link mechanism is a security fail-safe, ensuring that prevents others from connecting to your Hue bridge and thus, being able to control your lights.

### Joining the network
When it comes to joining the network, for any Philips Hue light or accessory has three options:
- Search: once the Philips Hue application is installed and opened, it will automatically start searching for lights. Lights and accessories that are powered for the first time, are automatically in `search mode`, allowing them to be found by the Hue bridge. Once the Hue bridge is done searching, all lights and accessories in search mode are automatically connected to the network. All this works using the Zigbee Commissioning standard, which specifies how new nodes are added to the network. https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/07-5123-06-zigbee-cluster-library-specification.pdf
Third party lights can be re-set (the method depends on the light being used), such that they are also in `search mode`, and can thus be found by the Hue bridge.
- Add serial number: an alternative method is using the Hue app to add lights to the network. This is done by adding the serial number of the light bulb in the Hue app. Afterwards, by starting the search method as defined above, the lights will be connected to the network.
- Touchlink: Zigbee supports a way to add third party lights and accessories to the network, by means of the Touchlink method. Using this method, two devices that are close together can be connected. Here, distance is measured by means of the receive- and transmission-power. PLAATJE
This Touchlink method also has a hazard: some third party lights and accessories have a very wide range (i.e. transmission power), which means sometimes Touchlink works unintentionally over long distances. We see here that these third-party lights can have a negative and unsecure effect on the deployment of a Philips Hue network.

https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/JN-UG-3091.pdf

The result is a mesh network. PLAATJE

### Secure communication

The network initiator, i.e. the Hue bridge, generates a random network key when the network is first formed and encrypts it using the ZLL master key. This network key is sent to any target node that wishes to join the network. The target node decrypts the ZLL master key. Any future communication is encrypted using the network key.
https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/JN-UG-3091.pdf

### Operation

Using the clusters (frames) specified in the ZLL standard, the Hue bridge controls the state of the lights:
Groups, Scenes, On/Off, Level Control, Colour Control.

Accessories such as a switch, dimmer, button are motion sensors are specified in the ZLL standard as control devices and communicate with the Hue bridge to control lights.

### Updates

The Hue bridge is updated using the Philips Hue app.
It checks for updates periodically using the backend system (trusted source).
The upgrade server (hue bridge) is notified of light updates by the backend system and notifies the light that an update is available.
Because the light may be off, the lights also periodically query the bridge for updates.
Lights are then updated using the Over The Air (OTA) Upgrade specified in the Zigbee standard.
Lights therefore update their code using a trusted source, the Hue Bridge.
Note that all communication is secure.

## Functionality mapping

### Normal use case

We will demonstrate the flow of control and flow of data of turning a light on using the Hue app.


### Adding a new device

We will illustrate the flow of control and flow of data of adding a new device to the network via Touchlink.

## Case study
### Internet connection lost
When internet connection is lost, the network itself still exists and all devices - including the Hue bridge - keep working.
As long as the user device is directly connected to the router using a WiFi connection (possibly without internet), the lights can still be controlled using the Hue app.

The only feature that is lost is the fact that the lights cannot be controlled outside the LAN.
This cannot be fixed, and can only be repaired by providing the router with an internet connection.

Additionally, note that without an internet connection, OTA upgrades and bridges updates can no longer be fetched from the internet.

### A device stops working
When a Hue bridge stops working, there is no bridge anymore between the Zigbee devices and the LAN, which means the lights can no longer be controlled using the Hue app.

However, a network can still be built between the Light nodes and controller nodes, which means lights can still be controlled using switches, dimmers, etc.
Some switches support direct connections with lights, for example the Hue dimmer switch can connect with up to ten light bulbs.
Note however that the features of changing the colours or light level of lights is lost, next to the connection to the Hue app.

When a light or controller device is disconnected, it can no longer be controlled by any controller node or the Hue app.
Since the network is a mesh network, the disconnection of a certain node might split the network in two, essentially creating two separate networks.
The network that includes the Hue bridge functions as normal, the nodes in the other network have to be re-connected, or might even be too far away to join the network at all.

If the router stops working, the lights can no longer be controlled by the Hue app.
Additionally, note that without a router, OTA upgrades and bridges updates can no longer be fetched from the internet.

### Conflicting command
Conflicting commands can be given when two separate users try to change the color of the same light.
The light always changes to the colour prescribed in the last command he got, which means the command of one of the two users is lost and the other is executed.
Afterwards, the network functions as usual, which means nothing breaks.

### Privacy
When connected to the internet, the Philips Hue privacy policy states that personal usage data can be collected with unclear purpose. 
Data can be analysed, and used for direct marketing communication.

Data consolidation can be turned off in the Hue app.
Additionally, the Philips Hue system can also be used without an internet connection, as stated above.
In this case, no data can be collected/stored by Philips Hue.
